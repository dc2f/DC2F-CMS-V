UI based on vaadin


Setup Development Environment
-----------------------------

This project was developed with Eclipse, therefore this is the prefered development platform.

Things you need on top of Eclipse Luna:
* m2e-wtp - Maven Integration for Eclipse WTP)
* lombok - [install it from their project page](http://projectlombok.org/download.html)

You may install the Eclipse Vaadin plugin but it works just fine without it.

Please set your workspace encoding to UTF-8 if you are on windows.
